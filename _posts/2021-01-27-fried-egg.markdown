### Instructions
1. On a medium stove burner, heat up a nonstick or well-seasoned cast iron pan.
2. Add oil and swirl to evenly coat the bottom of the pan.
3. As the oil starts to shimmer, crack the eggs into the pan.  
**Note:** If the eggs spatter, reduce the heat.
4. When the egg whites have set (3-4 minutes), use a spatula to gently plate the eggs.
5. Finish eggs with salt and pepper to taste.
