### Ingredients
* 2 eggs
* 1 tbsp white vinegar  

**Note:** The vinegar helps the egg whites set and does not affect the flavor of the egg.

### Instructions
1. Heat a 2-quart saucepan of water until it's barely boiling.
2. Turn the heat to low and add vinegar.
3. Crack the eggs into two small bowls.
4. Stir the water with a wooden spoon to create a vortex.
5. Slowly drop the egg from the bowl into the center of the vortex. The egg begins to set in a few seconds.
6. Gently swirl the water again and repeat the drop with the second egg.
7. After 2-3 minutes, when the yolks have firmed up but are still soft to the touch, remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels.
