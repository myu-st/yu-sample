### Instructions
1. Place eggs in a small saucepan with cold water.
2. Set the saucepan on medium-high heat until the water just starts to boil.
3. Turn the heat down to a low simmer and set a timer for 3 minutes.
4. After 3 minutes, remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and plunge in cold water to stop the cooking.
5. Carefully crack and roll the eggs thoroughly before peeling.

**Tip:** If you eat boiled eggs frequently, consider a $15 [egg steamer]. If you buy _one_ single-use kitchen gadget, this is the one to get.
